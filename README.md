# metec-prodopt
## Acknowledgement
This project is in development as part of our internship at Metec company which kindly granted their permission to show it as our term project. All data used in this project was taken from Metec’s production planning software.

## Problem Definition
Metec company produces various metal spare parts for cars and trucks as well as everything connected with simple or composed metal furniture appliances. As part of their production flow, the majority of items are produced in a multiple steps at different production departments.

As an amount of different items produced by a factory growth in variety, it becomes difficult to optimize production flows so every item travels a minimum amount of distance on a factory floor.

In a nutshell, this problem is about a perfect arrangement of factory departments so a distance traveled by all of the produced items would be minimal.

## Relevance
It’s clear that the situation Metec faced is not specific for this company. Most of not fully automated productions that are held by small and medium businesses are often driven by need so new items are started to be produced in non-systematic way. New items involve different workstations to be produced and transportation optimization sooner or later becomes a big problem to raise an overall production efficiency.

## Current Project State
Currently, the project is meant to be assesed only indoor by Metec company itself and provides a dashboard to revise transportation information across the factory floor. At some point of time though, `arachnid42` team is planning to expand the project functionality with API to allow it's usage by other interested parties.
